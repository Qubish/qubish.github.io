        <h2>Server Rules</h2>
        <p>To keep Rusty Tea a fun and fair place for everyone, please follow these rules. Failure to comply may result in warnings, kicks, or bans.</p>
        <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
            <li><strong>No Cheating or Exploits:</strong> Use of cheats, hacks, macros, or exploits is strictly prohibited. Any form of unfair advantage will result in an immediate ban.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Somewhat Respectful:</strong> Keep discussions civilâ€”banter, toxicity, and general Rust chatter is fine, but we do have limits. (Albeit higher than normal because, let's face it, it's Rust.)</li>
            <li><strong>No Spamming or Advertising:</strong> Do not flood chat with unnecessary messages. Advertising other servers or self-promotion is not permitted.</li>
            <li><strong>No Impersonation:</strong> Do not pretend to be staff, admins, or other players. Fake reports and misleading information will result in penalties.</li>
            <li><strong>Follow Admin Instructions:</strong> Admins are here to ensure fair play.</li>
